# QtCalculator
First steps in Qt framework with C++: an implementation of simple calculator app.

## Features
- [x] basic arithmetical operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 2nd power and square root,
- [x] additional results memory: MRC, M+, M- functions known from standard calculators,
- [x] alternative mode introducing additional math functions as seen on scientific mode in Windows calculator,
such as modulo, logarithms, exponential functions, factorial etc. and trigonometric functions tab in menu

### Basic mode
Allows performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square power and root calculation, changing sign,
percentage calculations and additional results memory (MRC, M+, M-).

### Scientific mode
Allows performing all basic operations (apart from memory) and additionally: inserting ùúã/e constants, generating random
real numbers between 0 and 1, modulo operation (for integers), factorial (for reals), natural logarithm, 2 and 10 base
logarithm, n-base logarithm, custom power function (x‚Åø), exponential functions (e, 10 base), absolute value and
inverting numbers (1/x). It also delivers additional menu tab with trigonometric functions.

### Programmer‚Äôs mode
Allows performing decimal/binary/hexadecimal/octal conversions, bitwise AND, OR, NOT, NOT, NAND, XOR operations. To be done: bit shifts.

## To be done
- [ ] deg/rad/grad modes in Scientific mode (for trigonometric functions).

## Disclaimer
Qt5Cored, Qt5Guid, Qt5Widgetsd DLLs, as well as plugins/platforms, plugins/styles DLLs have to be included in
executable's directory in order to run the app successfully (all DLLs included in `\dll`).

Compiled with MSVC 2019 64-bit.
